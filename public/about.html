<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Sohum Belagode, and I'm currently a Junior at NYU. I grew up most of my life in Tennessee before
  moving to Bradenton, Florida to play soccer at the sports academy IMG. 
</p>

<p>I'd like to think that I'm an adaptive and driven computer science student at NYU passionate about programming, statistics,
  the markets, and trading. I have gainved valuable experience working with financial professionals at UBS as they employ trading 
  strategies in different markets. I've also been responsible for creating machine learning models in Python to test quantitative 
  trading strategies. My most recent role as a data sciene intern at Scienaptic AI involved researching new applications of decision 
  tree-based models in Python.</p>
