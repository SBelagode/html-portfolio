<h1> Top Movies According to Sohum  </h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />


<h3> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</h3>
<p> This movie has an amzing twist. To truly appreciate the gravity of the twist, I highly recommend reading/watching 
    the previous movies. Regardless, the movie delivers and creatively brings to life one of the most iconic fantasy series 
    in the 21st century.

<h3> Creed </h3>
<p> This is a really modern, motivational take on the original Rocky movies. I believe any sports fan would be especially enthralled by 
    this movie </p>

<h3> Gods of Egypt</h3> 
<p> Gods of Egypt may be too  graphic for some viewers, but if you can look past some of the cheesy Hollywood gimmicks, 
    it's a great movie to 
</p>
